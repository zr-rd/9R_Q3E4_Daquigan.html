        <td class="col-md-2">She is a shy and occasionally socially awkward person. She initially wanted to go to Harvard but ends up choosing to attend Yale. Despite having a tendency to plan ahead and like to know what is ahead, Rory decides to pursue a career in journalism for whatever reason. She is praised for her dedication to writing, but she absolutely fails at journalism in real life, never comprehending that perhaps this is not the right career for her.</td>

        <td class="col-md-2">Lorelai Victoria Gilmore was born to Emily and Richard Gilmore in Hartford, Connecticut. Her life growing up was complicated due to an overbearing, neurotic mother and a workaholic father, who both expected Lorelai to live in their world of wealth and privilege. Lorelai is a highly talkative, free-spirited woman. Her parents had her future all planned out and arranged for her to come out to society after her sixteenth birthday, but Lorelai was always rebellious and resentful of her structured, sheltered and silver spoon upbringing. </td>

        <td class="col-md-2">Luke is Stars Hollow's local diner owner. He has lived in Stars Hollow his entire life, and his dad's hardware store (William's Hardware, in the middle of town) became his diner after his dad passed away. While his father was heavily involved in town events, Luke has resisted all of them, including most Town Meetings and the War Re-enactments. Though Luke expresses animosity towards town events, it is evident that he cares for the town and never has huge ambitions to leave.</td>

        <td class="col-md-2">Jess Mariano</td>
        <td class="col-md-2">Jess is the troubled love-interest of Rory Gilmore, son of Liz Danes and Jimmy Mariano, and nephew of Luke Danes. Jess is incredibly smart, quick-witted, and interested in the arts and literature, but not academically motivated. Jess tends to distance himself from people, leading to his breakup with Rory. Despite people reaching out to him, he often pushes them away without explanation.</td>

        <td class="col-md-2">Paris is a brutally honest, very driven person who is not afraid to bring up awkward conversations, often resulting in people running away. She is also one of the smartest people at Chilton and maybe even Yale. She will go to any length to get into her dream college, Harvard. An over-achiever, she seeks out every position she can hold at Chilton, becoming both editor of the school paper, the The Franklin, and president of the student council.</td>

        <td class="col-md-2">Lane Kim</td>
        <td class="col-md-2">Lane is Stars Hollow's resident music lover. Lane is seen toting what she refers to as the Mojo bible of music around, aiming to procure every last record in it. Due to her family's strict religious adherence, Lane is a master of ingenuity, successfully executing various schemes to procure the aforementioned tunes â€“ often with the help of her childhood best friend, Rory. Lane leads a double life, hidding all evidence of her American lifestyle such as rock CDs, make-up, and forbidden clothing under her floorboards, in her closet, and under the mattress in her bedroom.</td>
